\begin{abstract}
We present ``incremental late data layout'': an automated approach
that allows programmers to safely change object
representations---e.g., specialize a general data structure to yield
an optimized, packed form for efficiency. The approach allows changes
of data representations at fine granularities (e.g., in the body of a
single client method only) and without access to the original
definition being specialized. Our technique leverages the type system
in order to infer when values should be packed/unpacked and guarantees
correctness in the interaction with features such as generics,
inheritance and overriding. We have implemented the technique in Scala
and demonstrate significant benefit, of up to 14x, from data
specialization.
