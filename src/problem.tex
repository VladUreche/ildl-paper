\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:problem}

% Executive summary + vision
This section presents a motivating example featuring the complex number transformation, which we use throughout the paper. It then shows how the data representation transformation is triggered and introduces the terminology. Finally, it shows a naive transformation, hinting at the difficulties lying ahead.

\subsection{Motivating Example}

In the introduction, we focused on adding complex number semantics to
pairs of integers. Complex numbers with integers as both their real
and imaginary parts are known as Gaussian integers
\cite{gauss1828theoria,gaussian-integers-wikipedia}, and are a
countable subset of all complex numbers. The operations defined on
Gaussian integers are similar to complex number operations, with one
exception: to satisfy the abelian closure property, division is not precise,
but instead rounds the result to the nearest Gaussian integer, with both the real and imaginary
axes containing integers. This is similar to integer division, which
also rounds the result, so that, for example, |5/2| produces value
|2|.

% The following implicit class defines the Gaussian integer operators on pairs of integer numbers:
% \vlad{should we include this or spare the reader?}
% \begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
% implicit class PairOfIntAsGaussianInteger(n1: (Int, Int)) {
%   def c = (n1.re, -n1.im) // conjugate 1+2i => 1-2i
%   def re = n1._1
%   def im = n1._2
%   def norm = n1.re * n1.re + n1.im * n1.im
%   def +(n2: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = (n1.re + n2.re, n1.im + n2.im)
%   def -(n2: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = (n1.re - n2.re, n1.im - n2.im)
%   def *(n2: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = (n1.re * n2.re - n1.im * n2.im, n1.re * n2.im + n1.im * n2.re)
%   def /(n2: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = {
%     val denom = n2 * n2.c
%     val numer = n1 * n2.c
%     assert(denom.im == 0) // by multiplying with the conjugate, we reduce the imaginary part of the denominator
%     (math.round(numer.re.toFloat / denom.re), math.round(numer.im.toFloat / denom.re))
%   }
% }
% \end{lstlisting-nobreak}

An interesting property of Gaussian integers is that we can define the
``divides'' relation and the greatest common divisor (GCD) between any
two Gaussian integers. Furthermore, computing the GCD is similar to
Euclid's algorithm for integer numbers:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
def gcd(n1: (Int, Int), n2: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = {
  val remainder = n1 % n2
  if (remainder.norm == 0) n2 else gcd(n2, remainder)
}
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

Unfortunately, as our algorithm recursively computes the result, it creates linearly many pairs of integers, allocating them on the heap. If we run this algorithm with no optimizations, computing the GCD takes around 3 microseconds (on the same setup as used for our full experiments in \S\ref{sec:benchmarks}):

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
scala> timed(() => gcd((544, 185), (131, 181)))
The operation took `3.05 us` (based on 10000 executions).
The result was (10, 3).
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

However, if we encode the Gaussian integers into 64-bit long integers, we improve the time by a factor of 13x:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
scala> timed(() => gcdADRT((544, 185), (131, 181)))
The operation took `0.23 us` (based on 10000 executions).
The result was (10, 3).
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

Therefore, it is worthwhile to optimize the data representation. Still, transforming the code by hand is both tedious and error-prone, so a natural question to ask is whether the transformation could be automated.

\subsection{Automating the Transformation}
\label{sec:automating}

In order to reap the benefits of using the improved representation
without manually transforming the code, we present the Ad hoc Data
Representation (ADR) Transformation technique, which is triggered
by the |adrt| marker. This marker method accepts two parameters: the
first parameter is the \emph{transformation description object} and the
second is a block of code that constitutes the \emph{transformation scope}. This
scope can contain anything from individual expressions all the way to method, class,
trait and object definitions:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
`adrt(IntPairComplexToLongComplex)` {
  def gcdADRT(n1: (Int, Int), n2: (Int, Int)) = {
    val remainder = n1 % n2
    if (remainder.norm == 0) n2 else gcdADRT(n2, remainder)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

% To maintain a consistent naming throughout the paper, we will
% use the name \emph{high-level type} to designate |(Int, Int)|, which
% corresponds to the original type in the code. This high-level type can
% be encoded as its \emph{representation type}, |Long|, in order to
% provide a more compact representation and avoid
% object allocations. % The high-level
%type, its representation, and the procedures for encoding and decoding
%are all stored in the transformation description object, in our case
%|IntPairComplexToLongComplex|.
% With this, we have the vocabulary
%necessary to reason about our first (naive) approach to transforming
%the code.

During compilation, the code inside the |adrt| scope will be transformed to use the long integer representation instead of the pair of integers. We will now describe the two elements that trigger the transformation: the  description object and the transformation scope.

\subsubsection{The transformation description object} is responsible for defining the transformation that will be applied to the code. In our example, |IntPairComplexToLongComplex| defines a transformation from the \emph{high-level type}, in this case |(Int, Int)| to the \emph{representation type}, in this case |Long|:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
object IntPairComplexToLongComplex
          extends TransformationDescription {
  // coercions:
  def `toRepr`(high: (Int, Int)): Long = ...
  def `toHigh`(repr: Long): (Int, Int) = ...
  // operations:
  ...
}
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

\noindent
Transformation description objects are defined in Section \ref{sec:ildl}, but we can already hint at their components:
\begin{compactitem}
  \item The |toRepr| and |toHigh| methods serve a double purpose:
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item At the type level, they define the high-level type, in this case |(Int, Int)|, which serves as the target of the transformation and its representation type, in this case |Long|, which will be used as the optimized value representation;
    \item At the term level, they allow converting values between the two representations;
  \end{compactitem}
  \item The operations part of the definition allows operations such as |*|, |%| and |norm| to operate directly on the representation type (|Long| in this case) instead of converting back to |(Int, Int)|.
\end{compactitem}
\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent
Description objects split the task of optimizing the data representation into:
\begin{compactitem}
\item[(1)] Devising an improved data representation. Defining the improved data representation is done once and uses domain-specific knowledge about how the data is used in the program. Therefore, this is a task for which the developer is responsible, and the means of communicating the improved data representation to the compiler is the transformation description object.
\item[(2)] On the other hand, transforming the source code to use the improved representation is a repetitive, tedious and error-prone process, so it is best suited for the compiler.
\end{compactitem}

A natural question to ask is why not automate the process of finding a better data representation? Any change in the data representation speeds up certain patterns at the expense of slowing down others. For example, unboxing primitive types makes monomorphic code, which handles primitives directly, run much faster. Yet, erased generics still require values to be boxed, so any interaction with them triggers boxing operations, which slow down execution. %Thus, when mixing monomorphic and generic code, it's best to keep primitives boxed.

Furthermore, there are many aspects that can be optimized: eliminating pointer de-referencing, improving cache locality, reducing the memory footprint to avoid garbage collection pauses, reducing numeric value ranges, specializing or delaying operations and many others. Thus, there are many choices to make, depending on the context, to the point where automation does not make sense.

Instead, armed with application profiles and domain-specific information about how the data is used, a programmer can decide what is the best transformation to apply to each critical part of an application. And, interestingly, not all parts of an application have the same needs. This is where the |adrt| scope comes in.

\subsubsection{Transformations scopes} are delimited by the |adrt| marker method, which behaves much like a keyword. Values, methods and classes defined inside the |adrt| scope are visible outside, since the scope is inlined early in the compilation pipeline:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
scala> `adrt(IntPairComplexToLongComplex)` {
       |   def gcdADRT(n1: (Int, Int), n2: (Int, Int))={
       |     val remainder = n1 % n2
       |     if (remainder.norm == 0) n2 else ...
       |   }
       | }
defined method gcdADRT

scala> timed(() => gcdADRT((544, 185), (131, 181)))
...
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

Scoped transformations bring two advantages:

\begin{compactitem}
 \item Different parts of a program can use different transformations, using the best data representation for the task;
 \item Transformations are clearly signalled in the source code.
\end{compactitem}

The fact that different transformations can be applied in different components gives the ADR transformation its scoped nature, and sets it apart from classical optimizations such as unboxing primitive types, generic specialization and value class inlining, which are global. However, this scoped nature makes the transformatiom more complex, as the next paragraphs will show.

%For example, the Spark in-memory map-reduce framework \cite{matei-rdds} could keep the data in serialized format when about to pass it to another machine while storing it in a very compact format when doing in-memory processing.

\subsection{A Naive Transformation}

% It's important that's not a trivial transformation -- users will transform their input ... we'll look at this aspect again when rev

In our running example, using the long integer representation for Gaussian Integers serves several purposes:

\begin{compactitem}
  \item It provides a direct representation, which does not require any pointer de-referencing;
  \item It allocates Gaussian integers on the stack, since the |Long| primitive type is unboxed by the compiler backend.
\end{compactitem}

Despite its simple interface, the Ad hoc Data Representation Transformation mechanism is by no means simple. Let us try to make the transformation by hand and see the challenges that appear. The initial result, the |gcdNaive| method, would take and return values of type |Long| instead of |(Int, Int)|:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
def gcdNaive(n1: `Long`, n2: `Long`): `Long` = {
  val remainder = n1 % n2
  if (remainder.norm == 0) n2 else gcdNaive(n2, remainder)
}
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

There are many questions one could ask about this naive translation. For example, how does the compiler know which parameters and values to transform to the long integer representation (\S\ref{sec:ildl:custom})? How and when to encode and decode values, and what to do about values that are visible outside the scope (\S\ref{sec:ildl:scoped})? Even worse, what if parts of the code are compiled separately, in a different compiler run (\S\ref{sec:ildl:separate-compilation})?

Going into the semantics of the program, we can ask if the |%| (modulo) operator maintains the semantics of Gaussian integers when used for long integers. Also, is |norm| defined for long integers? Unfortunately, the response to both questions is negative. Therefore, the transformation needs to preserve semantics, which is not trivial (\S\ref{sec:ildl:method}).

We could also ask what would happen if |gcd| was overriding another method, as in the code fragment below. Would the new signature still override it? The answer is no, so the naive translation would break the object model (\S\ref{sec:ildl:language-features}):

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
trait WithGCD[`T`] {
  def gcd(n1: `T`, n2: `T`): `T`
}
class Complex extends WithGCD[`(Int, Int)`] {
  // expected: gcd(n1: (Int, Int), n2: (Int, Int)) ...
  // found:    gcd(n1: Long, n2: Long): Long
  // (which does not implement gcd in trait WithGCD)
  def gcd(n1: `Long`, n2: `Long`): `Long` = ...
}
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

What we can learn from this naive transformation, which is clearly incorrect, is that transforming the data representation is by no means trivial and that special care must be taken when performing it. Our approach, the Ad hoc Data Representation Transformation, addresses the questions above in a reliable and principled fashion.
