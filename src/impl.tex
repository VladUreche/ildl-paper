\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}
\begin{itemize}
  \item implementation - lexical scope transformation
\end{itemize}

% Two implementations in Scala, as a compiler plugins, starting from the LDL compiler plugins alreasdy available on the net. The rest will describe the important changes

% - |adrt| macro => inject phase; very close to the semantics of the multi-stage programming transformation for LDL

% - transformation description objects => bootstrapping problem => annotation

% - transformation description object  => depedency of the code => change it => recompile!

% - bridge - warinings

% - coerce - the main work was around using the extension methods and providing a good solution for them

% - commit -- very simple
